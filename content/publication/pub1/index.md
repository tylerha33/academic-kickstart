abstract: "Shock revival in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) may be due to the neutrino mechanism. While it is known that in a neutrino-powered CCSN, explosion begins when the neutrino lumin\
osity of the protoneutron star exceeds a critical value, the physics of this condition in time-dependent, multidimensional simulations is not fully understood. Pejcha & Thompson found that a\
n \"antesonic condition\" exists for time-steady spherically symmetric models, potentially giving a physical explanation for the critical curve observed in simulations. In this paper, we ext\
end that analysis to time-dependent, spherically symmetric polytropic models. We verify the critical antesonic condition in our simulations, showing that models exceeding it drive transonic \
winds whereas models below it exhibit steady accretion. In addition, we find that (1) high spatial resolution is needed for accurate determination of the antesonic ratio and shock radius at \
the critical curve, and that low-resolution simulations systematically underpredict these quantities, making explosion more difficult at lower resolution; (2) there is an important physical \
connection between the critical mass accretion rate at explosion and the mass-loss rate of the post-explosion wind: the two are directly proportional at criticality, implying that, at critic\
ality, the wind kinetic power is tied directly to the accretion power; (3) the value of the post-shock adiabatic index $\\Gamma$ has a large effect on the length and time-scales of the post-\
bounce evolution of the explosion, larger values of $\\Gamma$ result in a longer transition from the accretion to wind phases."
