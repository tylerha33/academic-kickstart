abstract: "Aims: Recent simulations have shown that asymmetries in the ejecta distribution of supernova remnants (SNRs) may be a reflection of asymmetries left over from the initial supernova explosion. Thus, SNR studies provide a vital means for testing and constraining model predictions in relation to the distribution of heavy elements, which are key to improving our understanding of the explosion mechanisms in Type Ia supernovae.
Methods: The use of a novel blind source separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the historic Kepler and Tycho supernova remnants has revealed maps of the ejecta distribution. These maps are endowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clear separations from the continuum emission. Our method also provides a three-dimensional (3D) view of the ejecta by individually disentangling red- and blueshifted spectral components associated with images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe emission. This approach provides insights into the morphology of the ejecta distribution in those two remnants.
Results: Those mappings have allowed us to thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the intermediate-mass elements and Fe distribution in two Type Ia supernova remnants. We also compared the results with the core-collapse Cassiopeia A remnant, which we had studied previously. The images obtained confirm, as expected for Type Ia SNRs, that the Fe distribution is mostly closer to the core than that of intermediate-mass elements. They also highlight peculiar features in the ejecta distribution, such as the Fe-rich southeastern knot in Tycho. "
