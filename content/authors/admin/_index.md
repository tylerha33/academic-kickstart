I am currently working with Professor Laura Lopez on X-ray observations of Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our goal is to, through spatially-resolved imaging and spectral analysis, study the distribution and properties of ejecta in SNRs to learn more about the processes that occur during supernova explosions. During my time at OSU, I have analyzed X-ray data from \*\*Chandra\*\* shown that NSs are kicked preferentially opposite to the bulk ejecta in a sample of Milky Way core-collapse SNRs. In addition, I have shown that in the SNR Cassiopeia A, the NS is kicked most opposite to the heaviest elements, and these heavier elements (e.g., Ar, Ca, Ti, and Fe) exhibit more asymmetric profiles than lighter elements (e.g., Si, S, Ar). These findings are consistent with the theory that, through asymmetric explosion mechanisms, the NS kicks arise from conservation of momentum with ejecta rather than with anisotropic neutrino mechanism, consistent with recent 3D supernova simulations. 

I have also investigated the presence of recombining plasma in the SNR W49B, making use
