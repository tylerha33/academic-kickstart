\    I am currently working with Professor Laura Lopez on X-ray observations of Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our goal is to, through spatially-resolved imaging and spectral analysis, study the distribution and properties of ejecta in SNRs to learn more about the processes that occur during supernova explosions. During my time at OSU, I have analyzed X-ray data from *Chandra*, *XMM-Newton*, *ROSAT,* and *Suzaku* X-ray telescopes. I have investigated the asymmetries of both bulk ejecta and specific elements in SNRs, performing spectral fitting using the X-ray analysis software Xspec and AtomDB, and compared the asymmetries to other elements' asymmetries and NS kick direction. I have studied recombining plasma in the SNR W49B, creating spectral fits to 46 regions in the remnant using *XMM-Newton* data in order to investigate the properties and presence of overionized plasma throughout the remnant and constrain the origin of rapid cooling.

\    I am currently working on quantifying individual elements' asymmetries in SNRs other than Cassiopeia A and measuring the mass ratios of Fe-group elements in MW and LMC Type Ia SNRs in order to place constraints on their progenitors through comparison to 3D SNe simulations. In the future, I will make use of the incredibly detailed spectra from microcalorimeters like *XRISM* and *Lynx* to study the 3D distribution and make more precise mass measurements of ejecta metals in SNRs.
