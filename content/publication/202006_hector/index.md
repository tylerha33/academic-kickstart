abstract: "The explosive origin of the young supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 (G41.1-0.3) is debated. Its elongated morphology and proximity to a molecular cloud are suggestive of a core-collapse (CC) SN origin, yet recent X-ray studies of heavy metals show chemical yields and line centroid energies consistent with a Type Ia SN. In this paper, we analyze the full X-ray spectrum from 0.7-10 keV of 3C 397 observed with Suzaku and compare the line centroid energies, fluxes, and elemental abundances of intermediate-mass and heavy metals (Mg to Ni) to Type Ia and CC hydrodynamical model predictions. Based on the results, we conclude that 3C 397 likely arises from an energetic Type Ia explosion in a high-density ambient medium, and we show that the progenitor was a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf."
