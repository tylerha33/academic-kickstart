My work involves using X-ray observations to study supernova remnants (SNRs), using spatially resolved imaging and spectral analysis to study the properties of their ejecta along with any compact objects embedded within. I then compare these results to the theoretical predictions of supernova simulations and observational work in other wavelengths in order to learn more about the processes that occur during supernova explosions and as SNRs expand through their surrounding medium. I have analyzed data from *Chandra*, *XMM-Newton*, *ROSAT,* and *Suzaku* X-ray telescopes.

As a graduate student at The Ohio State University, I investigated the asymmetries of bulk ejecta in multiple SNRs and specific elements in the SNR Cassiopeia A, performing spectral fitting using the X-ray analysis software Xspec and AtomDB. I quantified the ejecta asymmetries and compared them to each other and NS kick velocity, finding that NSs are preferentially kicked opposite to the bulk of ejecta. In another project, I studied recombining plasma in the SNR W49B, creating spectral fits to 46 regions in the remnant in order to investigate the properties and presence of overionized plasma and constrain the origin of rapid cooling. 

As a Future Faculty Leader Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, I have performed a detailed analysis of the global X-ray emission in Kepler's SNR, fitting the entire 0.5-8.0 keV spectrum in order to measure the mass ratios of various ejecta elemenets and the SNRs to specific Type Ia progenitor scenarios. In order to obtain accurate results, I incorporated the effects of *Suzaku's* effective area calibration uncertainties and the effects of the unknown emitting volumes of different plasma components. Additionally, I measured the proper motion of the neutron star in the SNR Cassiopeia A, making use of the wealth of data taken using *Chandra* from 1999 to present. Even though there are few point sources for which to perform astrometric calibration (necessary for the small <0.1 arcsec/year motions), the sheer number of observations can be used in order to reduce errors and obtain a more precise velocity measurement. Finally, I collaborated with Dr. Adrien Picquenot to use the General Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA) technique to study Kepler's and Tycho SNRs. We aim to identify the asymmetries of different elements, the plasma properties of different regions of the SNR, and disentangle different types of X-ray emitting material: i.e., swept-up CSM vs Fe-rich vs intermediate-mass ejecta dominant.

Currently, as an NPP Fellow at NASA GSFC, I am building upon my past research and beginning to incorporate *XRISM* data in my analysis of SNRs. I am currently doing a similar global, full-X-ray-spectrum analysis of Tycho's SNR and plan to build up a large sample of SNRs analyzed using this method. Additionally, I aim to continue measuring the velocities of NSs embedded in SNRs; these velocities can be compared to the ejecta asymmetries and SNR energetics to help further our knowledge of explosion physics and the mechanism(s) by which NSs are accelerated. In my projects going forward, I will use the incredibly detailed spectra from microcalorimeters like *XRISM* to study the 3D distribution of and make precise measurements of ejecta metals and plasma properties in SNRs, making use of it and other telescopes' data simultaneously.

<!---I am currently working with Professor Laura Lopez on X-ray observations of supernova remnants (SNRs). Our goal is to, through spatially resolved imaging and spectral analysis, study the distribution and properties of ejecta in SNRs and learn more about the processes that occur during supernova explosions. --->


<!---I am currently working on quantifying individual elements' asymmetries in SNRs other than Cassiopeia A (for which I led a successful Chandra archival proposal to support) and measuring the mass ratios of Fe-group elements in MW and LMC Type Ia SNRs. The former project will build on my previous analysis of asymmetries in SNR ejecta, and the latter will be used to place constraints on Type Ia SNe progenitors through comparison to the results of 3D SNe simulations. --->
